# dotfiles

Fantastic .dotfiles and where to find them

# notes

alacritty installed with snap, tabby did not work
needed to install zsh with apt and make it default
install antigen
zsh failed
pyenv nvm and maybe others bewlow
missimg themes
script to install oh my posh (themes) did not run on ubuntu (something is wrong with this line     elif [[ $(uname) == 'Linux' ]] && [[ $(uname -m) == 'x86_64' ]]; then)
font script worked like a charm

font in alacritty was very wrong spacing (needed to remove the last 'Mono' in the font name, then it worked but it is huge size! 10 is better but still big)  + it looks weird with margins

git seems to work? no way to try? no, it didn't gpg key fails -> but check <https://filipe.kiss.ink/multiple-gpg-keys-git/>

manage to install another gpg key, with CLI can add file but needs to be generated following github page instructions

installed neofetch, apt ...
